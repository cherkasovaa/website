export const ABOUT_TEXT = `For me, code is more than just a job; it's a way to tell stories and solve problems. My own journey in the IT world began with a unique and significant mission.

In 2018, an entire era of Flash games, once played by millions, was at risk of disappearing. I had the privilege of being part of a team at Absolutist that worked to preserve this digital heritage. We developed technology that gave a second life to thousands of projects, making them compatible with modern browsers.

At the same time, my curiosity about how the web works led me to freelancing and introduced me to the world of SEO. Years of experience taught me a crucial lesson: the importance of building products that connect with their users. This means that in my work, no detail is too small. My approach is to create a product that is loved by both users and search engines.

Today, I am fully focused on Frontend development and am deeply immersed in the modern tech stack. I aim to bring value to businesses and users by creating fast and beautiful web applications. I am always open to new challenges and interesting projects where I can apply my diverse experience.

In my free time, I trade my screen for visits to museums or the greenery of parks. I cherish the time spent with my family and happily share my work chair with my two cats.`;
