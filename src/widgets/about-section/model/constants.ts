export const ABOUT_TEXT = `For me, <span>code is more than just a job</span>, it's a way to tell stories and solve problems. My own journey in the IT world began with a unique and significant mission.

In 2018, an entire era of Flash games, once played by millions, was at risk of disappearing. I had the privilege of being part of a team at Absolutist that worked to preserve this digital heritage. We developed technology that <span>gave a second life to thousands of projects</span>, making them compatible with modern browsers.

At the same time, my curiosity about how the web works led me to freelancing and introduced me to the world of <span>SEO</span>. Years of experience taught me a crucial lesson: the importance of building products that <span>connect with their users</span>. This means that in my work, no detail is too small. My approach is to create a product that is <span>loved by</span> both <span>users and search engines</span>.

Today, I am fully focused on <span>Frontend development</span> and am deeply immersed in the <span>modern tech stack</span>. I aim to bring value to businesses and users by creating <span>fast and beautiful web applications</span>. I am always open to new challenges and interesting projects where I can apply my <span>diverse experience</span>.

In my free time, I visit museums or walk in parks. I cherish the time spent with my family and happily share my work chair with my two cats.`;
